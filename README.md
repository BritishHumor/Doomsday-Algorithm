# Doomsday-Algorithm

The Doomsday Algorithm ( as mentioned here: https://devrant.com/rants/1000628 ) is the most harmless and wrongly named Algorithms I've ever come across.
The basis of the Algorithm is the following:

> an algorithm of determination of the day of the week for a given date. - Wikipedia (Doomsday Rule)

In short, you give it a date and it tells you the day of the week, as simple as that.

This was probably one of my first 'complex' programs I wrote back when I was probably somewhere between 12-14 years old, it was written in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC) and honestly reading it now I can bearly make any sense of it myself.

Currently I only have access to a recently modified version of the code, but I want to upload to absolute original so I have someone working on finding it for me and it should be available within the next couple of days.

Once it is available I'll upload it here under the MIT License and maybe in the future I'll rewrite it for another language but this time I wont have out 12+ if statements nested within one another.

Till Then!
