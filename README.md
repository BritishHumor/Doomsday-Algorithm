# Doomsday-Algorithm

The Doomsday Algorithm ( as mentioned here: https://devrant.com/rants/1000628 ) is the most harmless and wrongly named Algorithms I've ever come across.
The basis of the Algorithm is the following:

> an algorithm of determination of the day of the week for a given date. - Wikipedia (Doomsday Rule)

In short, you give it a date and it tells you the day of the week, as simple as that.

This was probably one of my first 'complex' programs I wrote back when I was probably somewhere between 12-14 years old, it was written in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC) and honestly reading it now I can bearly make any sense of it myself.

The File is now available in it's original format **'Doomsday Algorithm.bbc'** this **WILL** require the [BBC BASIC editor](http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcbasic.html) to run the code, and in the future I will re write other language versions of this.
